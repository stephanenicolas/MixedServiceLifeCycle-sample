<h1>Bound Life cycle</h1>

<p>
A service is bound when you call : <tt>bindService( Intent, ServiceConnection )</tt>.
</p>

<p>
It then remains bound until you call : <tt>unBind( Intent )</tt> or the binding context finishes.
You can rotate the device to finish a binding context (the binding context is the activity here).
</p>

<p>
When a (purely) bounded service is not bounded anymore, it is destroyed (stopped).
</p>

<h1>Binding callbacks</h1>

<p>
The binding context can use the <tt>ServiceConnection</tt> as a binding callback. It will get notified when it is bound : 
the <tt>onServiceConnected</tt> will be invoked.
</p>

<p>
However, the <tt>onServiceDisconnected</tt> method is not called when the binding context unbinds. It is only called in case 
of abrupt unbinding such as the binding context being destroyed or the service being killed.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, when a service is bound for the second time (or more), neither <tt>onServiceConnected</tt> will be invoked on the <tt>ServiceConnection</tt>, 
neither <tt>onBind</tt> is called on the <tt>Service</tt>. Nevertheless, multiple bindings are effective.
