<h1>Information</h1>

<p>
This app is a Demo application designed to explain the different life cycles of services.
</p>

<p>
The documentation of the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html"> Service class</a> is quite clear but it's difficult to get a clear understanding of how things work in an app,
how services life cycles and activities life cycles differ from each other. The app just examplifies these points. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the documentation of the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html"> Services</a> is elusive about the possibility of getting a service that is both started 
and bound. This app allows to experiment with the uncommon life cycle and understand it fully.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we also added some features to let you play with the Sticky/Non-Sticky values returned by <tt>onStartCommand</tt>.
And you can also see the difference between a "normal" service and a service put in the foreground.
